Also classify whether the piece reads as straight news reporting or opinion/editorial/analysis.

For each claim, also provide a one-sentence context field that resolves any vague references — pronouns, demonstratives ("such services", "the measure", "this bill", "those cuts"), and shorthand — by substituting the specific referent found in the surrounding article text. If the claim is already fully self-contained, set context to be identical to the claim.

CRITICAL — names of people: Never extract a surname alone (e.g. "Castro", "Smith", "Johnson"). Always use the full name as established in the article. If the article introduces the person with a title or role (e.g. "Senator", "CEO", "President"), include that identifier too (e.g. "Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ)", "Fidel Castro, former Cuban leader").

${formatSourcesForPrompt(sources)}

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact shape, no prose, no markdown fences:
{
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "confidence_rationale": "one sentence on why",
  "supporting_sources": [{"outlet": "...", "lean": "...", "url": "...", "title": "..."}],
  "contradicting_sources": [{"outlet": "...", "lean": "...", "url": "...", "title": "..."}],
  "primary_sources": [{"outlet": "...", "url": "...", "title": "..."}],
  "divergence_summary": "one or two sentences on how coverage of this claim differs across outlets, naming outlets and their framing — or 'No notable divergence found' if coverage is consistent",
  "outlet_positions": [{"outlet": "...", "lean": "...", "position": "short description of how this outlet frames/reports the claim"}]
}

Confidence thresholds — apply these strictly:
- "high": 3 or more independent sources confirm the claim, OR at least one primary source (AP/Reuters wire, .gov data) directly confirms it, AND there is no credible contradiction. Do not downgrade for temporal uncertainty (e.g., "this is a recent event") if search results confirm the claim — the search results ARE the evidence.
- "medium": The claim has some support but meaningful gaps remain — indirect evidence only, mixed signals, OR one credible contradicting source among several supporting ones.
- "low": No sources confirm the claim, sources actively contradict it, or the results do not address the claim at all.

Contradiction rules:
- Before flagging a source as contradicting, check whether the apparent discrepancy is a time zone difference (e.g., 7:30 p.m. CT vs 8:30 p.m. ET are the same moment), a unit difference, or a rounding difference. If so, it is NOT a true contradiction — treat both sources as supporting.
- A single low-credibility or local source contradicting several major outlets is weak contradiction. Favor "high" confidence if 4+ credible sources agree.

Additional rules:
- Only cite outlets/URLs that appear in the search results above — never invent sources.
- If the search results don't clearly address the claim, use "low" confidence and say so in the rationale.
- Keep "outlet_positions" to at most 4 entries, prioritizing outlets with different "lean" labels.
- PRIMARY SOURCES are government data (.gov sites), official wire service dispatches (AP/Reuters), peer-reviewed academic sources (.edu, academic journals), official government transcripts, and intergovernmental bodies (UN, WHO, World Bank). Reliable media outlets such as BBC, NPR, CNN, or The Guardian do NOT qualify as primary sources regardless of their reputation — list those under supporting_sources instead.`;
